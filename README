RDF::Query - A SPARQL/RDQL implementation for RDF::Redland and RDF::Core

   RDF::Query allows RDQL and SPARQL queries to be run against an RDF model, returning rows of matching results.

REQUIREMENTS

	To install RDF::Query you'll need the following perl modules installed:
     * Parse::RecDescent
     * LWP::Simple
     * RDF::Core or RDF::Redland

INSTALLATION

   To install, run:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

     * Added missing SPARQL OFFSET grammar rules.
     * Added XML Results support for graph and boolean queries (DESCRIBE, CONSTRUCT, ASK).
     * Fixed major bugs in RDF::Core bridge:
          + Bridge wasn't using passed model.
          + Literal construction was broken.
          + Blank node construction was broken when no identifier was specified.
     * Stream::bindings_count now returns the right number even if there is no data.
     * XML Result format now works with RDF::Core models.
     * The Model bridge object is now passed to the Stream constructor.
     * Internal code now uses the variables method.
     * Removed redundant code from ORDER BY/LIMIT/OFFSET handling.
     * Removed unused count method.
     * Removed unused delegating AUTOLOAD.
     * Removed unused parse_files method.
     * Removed usused add_file method.
     * Removed duplicate net test file.
     * Added test file for local file-based SPARQL 'FROM' queries.
     * Added test file for SPARQL Result Forms (LIMIT, ORDER BY, OFFSET, DISTINCT).
     * Added test file for SPARQL Protocol for RDF (XML Results).
     * Added new tests based on Devel::Cover results.
     * Some test files now run against both Redland and RDF::Core:
          + 00-simple.t
          + 03-coverage.t
          + 10-sparql_protocol.t
     * All debugging is now centrally located in the _debug method.
     * Moved Stream class to lib/RDF/Query/Stream.pm.
     * Fixed tests that broke with previous fix to CONSTRUCT queries.
     * Fixed tests that broke with previous change to ASK query results.

     * Added support for SPARQL OPTIONAL graph patterns.
     * Calling bindings_count on a stream now returns 0 with no data.
     * Added Stream methods:
          + is_bindings
          + binding_name
          + binding_values
          + binding_names
     * Added as_xml method to Stream class for XML Binding Results format.</li>

     * Updated FILTER test to use new Geo::Distance API.

  Version 1.015 (2005-05-03)

     * Fixes to the arguments passed to FILTERs.
     * Filter tests now show example of two custom filters:
          + Transitive subClassOf testing.
          + Logical comparison operators (range testing lat/lon values).
     * Added literal_value, uri_value, and blank_identifier methods to bridges.
     * Redland bridge now calls sources/arcs/targets when only one field is missing.
     * Fixes to stream code. Iterators are now destroyed in a timely manner.
          + Complex queries no longer max out mysql connections under Redland.
     * Cleaned up node sorting code.
          + Removed dependency on Sort::Naturally.
          + Added new node sorting function ncmp().
     * check_constraints now calls ncmp() for logical comparisons.
     * Added get_value method to make bridge calls and return a scalar value.
     * Fixed node creation in Redland bridge.
     * Moved DISTINCT handling code to occur before LIMITing.
     * Added variables method to retrieve bound variable names.
     * Added binding_count and get_all methods to streams.
     * get_statments bridge methods now return RDF::Query::Stream objects.

  Version 1.014 (2005-04-26)

     * Made FILTERs work in SPARQL.
     * Added initial SPARQL support for custom function constraints.

     * Streams are now objects usinig the Redland QueryResult API.
     * RDF namespace is now always available in queries.
     * row() now uses a stream when calling execute().
     * Added ORDER BY support to RDQL parser.
     * SPARQL constraints now properly use the 'FILTER' keyword.
     * SPARQL constraints can now use '&&' as an operator.
     * SPARQL namespace declaration is now optional.

     * Added initial support for a SPARQL parser.
          + Added support for blank nodes.
          + Added lots of syntactic sugar (with blank nodes, multiple predicates and objects).
          + Added SPARQL support for DISTINCT and ORDER BY.
     * Moved model-specific code into RDF::Query::Model::*.
     * Moving over to redland's query API (pass in the model when query is executed).
