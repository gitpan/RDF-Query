RDF::Query - A SPARQL/RDQL implementation for RDF::Redland and RDF::Core

   RDF::Query allows RDQL and SPARQL queries to be run against an RDF model, returning rows of matching results.

REQUIREMENTS

	To install RDF::Query you'll need the following perl modules installed:
     * Parse::RecDescent
     * LWP::Simple
     * RDF::Core or RDF::Redland

INSTALLATION

   To install, run:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

VERSION HISTORY

  Version 1.012 (2005-04-24)

     * Stream objects now handle being constructed with an undef coderef.
     * Streams are now objects usinig the Redland QueryResult API.
     * RDF namespace is now always available in queries.
     * row() now uses a stream when calling execute().
     * Added ORDER BY support to RDQL parser.
     * SPARQL constraints now properly use the 'FILTER' keyword.
     * SPARQL constraints can now use '&&' as an operator.
     * SPARQL namespace declaration is now optional.
     * Updated tests.

  Version 1.010 (2005-04-21)

     * execute now returns an iterator.
     * Added core support for DISTINCT, LIMIT, OFFSET.
     * Added initial core support for ORDER BY (only works on one column right now).
     * Broke out the query parser into it's own RDQL class.
     * Added initial support for a SPARQL parser.
          + Added support for blank nodes.
          + Added lots of syntactic sugar (with blank nodes, multiple predicates and objects).
          + Added SPARQL support for DISTINCT and ORDER BY.
     * Moved model-specific code into RDF::Query::Model::*.
     * Moving over to redland's query API (pass in the model when query is executed).
